# Unit 1

## Intro 

**Course**

This course is Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science. The course code is ICS3U.

**Programming Langauge**

We will be using the Python programming langauge in this course.

Python is a commonly used beginner programming language since it is considered to be more easily readable and has simpler syntax than other mainstream languages. **Syntax** refers to the rules of a programming language; similarly to how grammar refers to the rules of a human language.

Python is also a relatively powerful language. It is used to support YouTube, Google, Instagram, Reddit, and other popular software programs.

Python has consistently been in the top three most popular programming langauges over the past two decades. Other languages that have been consistantly popular include Java, C, and Javascript.

**Learning Goals**

By the end of this unit, I will be able to do all the following in Python:

* Name and create variables using Python conventions
* Use variables to store values
* Create strings with special characters
* Use string operators to manipulate strings
* Print text to the console
* Create user prompts and take user input
* Create and use ints and floats
* Cast string, int, and floats
* Use numeric operators to manipulate ints and floats
* Create Boolean expressions
* Create conditional structures
* Create custom functions
* Create loop structures
* Use built-in string methods
* Use line comments to annotate code
* Use the Internet (including the Python Reference site) to find helpful information

**Expected Student Background:** 

An understanding of how to use school computers responsibly and ethically will be pre-taught before this unit. No prior programming experience is required. 

**Timing:**

The alloted time for this unit is three weeks. If you finish early, you may work on self-directed projects, help your classmates, or move on to Unit 2.

## Philosophy / Guiding Principles

In this introductory course, you will be gaining a solid foundation for the Python programming language. The programming concepts you learn will also be helpful for any future programming langauges you learn in the future.

Each class, we will begin with a class activity to introduce new concepts and get warmed up. After the activity, you will be working at your own pace through the content on our Replit Team. Before you begin each exercize, there are one to three bite-sized videos (5 minutes or less) to watch that demonstrate the concepts needed for the exercizes and there are accompanying notes that cover the same concepts but in more detail. 

When you submit an exercise, you will receive written feedback on your code. Check your notifications to check for new messages. You may reply to these messages by clicking on the thread. **You may resubmit the exercises as many times as you wish.**

Whenever you are stuck on a task, you are encouraged to ask for suggestions/hints. Begin a new thread by highlighting the part of your program you're stuck on and clicking on *Start Thread*.

## Summarized Overview 

Here is an overview of the tasks from Unit 1.

**Welcome**: An exercise to practice user input.

**ASCII Cat**: An exercise to practice print statements and special characters.

**Exact Change**: An exercise to practice numeric operators and casting.

**Leap Year**: An exercise to practice Booleans and conditionals.

**Input Checker**: An exercise to practice using built-in functions.

**Powers of Three**: An exercise to practice custom functions and loops.

**Project**: A console-based project to practice all the skills learned so far.
